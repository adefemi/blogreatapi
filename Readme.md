# Djuix.io - README.md

This README provides an overview of the project setup and instructions on how to run the server for your Djuix project.

## Overview

This project uses docker, docker-compose, and bash script to set things up and run the server.

1. `Dockerfile`: Basic Dockerfile configuration to build up the project
2. `docker-compose.yml`: Docker compose configuration to streamline process
3. `start-server.sh`: This controls every process

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Usage

### Start the Django server

To start the Django server, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./start_server.sh
```

This script builds the project by running `docker-compose build` then starts the server by running `docker-compose up -d`, the `-d` signifies detach mode.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the shell script (`start-server.sh`) have executable permissions. You can set the permissions by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x start-server.sh
```

If you encounter any issues, please consult the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) for further guidance.

At this point, what you have with you is mainly a django project.
